                <p>The following tests were performed on an M1 Apple Macbook Air with 8GB RAM and 256GB Storage. The IDE used for these tests is Visual Studio 2022 for Mac. The outputs produced were recorded and the results attached below are the findings of the analysis. The variables in this were No of unique propositional atoms, The height of the parse tree and the time taken for the execution in millseconds. In order to make this a fairer analysis the truth values were kept constant with all being assigned to 1 as changing the truth values leads to different times as seen in the output testing done previously. This data was recorded in a csv file and was analysed in a jupyter notebook attached in the analysis folder.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 head"><p>This is a heatmap with the correlation between each of the time variables. As we could observe from the graph te correlation between height of the parse tree and Time in ms is 0.88 which is a very high correlation. Surprisingly, the correlation between Number of unique propositional atoms and height of the tree is not very high. This is because as we have seen in the readings table the number of unique propositional atoms can be few but if the same atoms are repeated again and again the height of the tree increases drastically. Due to the same reason the correlation between time and the number of unique propositional atoms is also not very strong. </p></div>
