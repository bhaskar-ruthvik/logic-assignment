/// The assignment has been written and tested on an Asus Zephyrus G14 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800HS CPU, an NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPU, 16GB Dual-channel RAM and 1TB ROM. 
/// The IDE used for the project is Visual Studio Code for Windows x64 and the code has been written in C++ 20
/// Doxygen has been used to make the documentation work easier
/// The project uses a stack class implemented using a Linked-List and a Binary Tree as the Primary Data Structures
/// "using namespace std" has not been used so as to avoid name clashes with other functions in the STL library 
/// The memory usage has been tested using the visual studio code developer tools
/// The time taken by the program to execute has been measured using the chrono library along with some useful functions from iomanip and ios libraries
///
//including the required header files

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "LogicAssignment.h"

/// Main function that runs the LogicAssignment() function
int main(){
    LogicAssignment();
